Notes/to-do:

- deal with testing addresses for async

- tests for adapters writelines

- testing.listener doesn't use the address argument.
  should be possible to set up a testing listener that a client can connect
  to.

- fix method nameing, deprecating camel-case methods

- Reference docs in sphinx

- call handle_exception when handle_input fails. (?)

- Maybe add note on logging.

- in ref section, talk about async thread control
